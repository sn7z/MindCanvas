# MindCanvas - AI Knowledge Graph

Transform your browsing history into an intelligent, searchable knowledge network. MindCanvas uses AI to analyze your web content, extract relationships, and create an interactive knowledge graph you can explore and query.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In our information-rich digital age, we consume vast amounts of content daily through browsing, reading articles, tutorials, and documentation. However, this knowledge remains scattered and disconnected, making it nearly impossible to:
- Discover relationships between different topics you've learned
- Recall and build upon previous knowledge effectively  
- Identify knowledge gaps in your learning journey
- Leverage AI to understand and connect your personal knowledge

MindCanvas solves this by transforming your browsing history into an intelligent, searchable knowledge network powered by AI.
